The commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. Virgin Galactic is providing suborbital spaceflights. Rocket Lab is a small satellite provider. Blue Origin manufactures sub-orbital and orbital reusable rockets. Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX. SpaceX’s accomplishments include: Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station. Starlink, a satellite internet constellation providing satellite Internet access. Sending manned missions to Space. One reason SpaceX can do this is the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Spaces X’s Falcon 9 launch like regular rockets. 


Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. 

We need to determine 

1. The price of each launch by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for your team. 
2. If SpaceX will reuse the first stage. 

Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, we need to train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
